# Overlord Component Interaction Contract

Contract Version: `0.2-draft`

## Purpose

This is the normative specification for how Overlord's components interact. It defines:

- The **component registry** — what each component owns and is responsible for
- **Interaction surfaces** — the only sanctioned communication paths between components
- **Stable interfaces** — what cannot change without a contract version bump
- **Extension points** — the only sanctioned ways to extend Overlord
- **Conformance requirements** — what a shipped component must satisfy before integration
- **Maintenance rules** — when and how to update this document

**Agents and developers MUST read this document before implementing any change that crosses module boundaries, and MUST update it before implementing any change that extends or conflicts with the current contract.**

See `.claude/skills/component-contract.md` for the enforced agent workflow.

## Contract Version

Current version: `0.2-draft`

The contract version is incremented when any stable interface changes. All conformance manifests must declare the contract version they were validated against.

| Version | Changes |
| --- | --- |
| `0.2-draft` | Adds `authToDatabase` interaction surface and Better Auth implementation tables; clarifies Better Auth uses the configured database adapter. |
| `0.1-draft` | Initial component interaction contract. |

---

## Component Registry

Each component owns a defined set of responsibilities. No component may directly access another's internals — use only the declared interaction surfaces.

## Interaction Surfaces

These are the **only sanctioned paths** between components. Bypassing these surfaces is a contract violation.

### Agent → Protocol (Primary Ticket Surface)

- **Transport**: Subprocess CLI invocation of `ovld protocol <command>`
- **Authentication**: Session key passed as flag or environment variable
- **Required sequence**: `attach → (update|heartbeat)* → (ask|deliver)`
- **Response format**: JSON on stdout; non-zero exit on error
- **Shell-special content**: Must use `--summary-file -` / `--payload-file -` with stdin heredoc

### Protocol → Database (Service Layer)

- **Transport**: Service layer function calls within ACID transactions
- **Rule**: No direct table writes from protocol handlers; use the service layer
- **Concurrency**: Optimistic compare-and-set via `revision`; zero-row update = `409` conflict
- **Change feed**: `entity_changes` appended in same transaction as domain mutation
- **Idempotency**: Protocol-scope idempotency keys in `idempotency_keys`

### CLI → Database (Management Surface)

- **Transport**: Service layer function calls
- **Rule**: Same service layer as Protocol Layer; identical transaction semantics
- **Project context**: Resolved via `.overlord/project.json` and working directory

### Connector → Protocol (Hook Surface)

- **Hooks**: `UserPromptSubmit`, `PermissionRequest`, `Stop` (future)
- **Transport**: Shell scripts invoking `ovld protocol hook-event` or `update`
- **Rule**: Hook scripts must not write to the database directly; use protocol commands only

### Runner → Database (Queue Surface)

- **Transport**: Service layer function calls in ACID transactions
- **Claiming**: Atomic compare-and-set claim on `execution_requests`; verify launchable state
- **Side effects**: Claim must append `ticket_events` and `entity_changes` in same transaction

### REST API → Database (HTTP Surface)

- **Transport**: Service layer function calls; same service layer as CLI and Protocol
- **Auth**: Token or session auth via Auth Layer before service call
- **Response shape**: Derived from logical schema camelCase field names
- **Idempotency**: REST-scope idempotency keys for retried writes

### Auth → Database (Identity Bridge)

- **Transport**: Better Auth's configured database adapter for auth tables; direct service-layer/database adapter queries for identity bridging
- **Auth tables owned**: `user`, `session`, `account`, `verification`, `apikey` — auth-internal; no other component accesses them directly
- **Identity bridge**: Auth Layer reads `workspace_users` and `users` (via `users.external_subject` / `users.auth_provider = 'better-auth'`) to resolve an authenticated identity to an Overlord `Actor`
- **Role resolution**: Auth Layer reads `role_assignments` for the resolved workspace user to build the `Actor`'s role list
- **Rule**: Auth Layer must not write to core domain tables (tickets, projects, etc.)

### Extension → Core (Extension Surface)

- **Database**: Migrations in `ext_<name>_` prefixed tables; `schema_migrations.component = 'ext:<name>'`
- **Metadata**: Namespaced keys in `metadata_json` / `settings_json` (reverse-DNS or package-style)
- **Reactions**: Via service APIs, `entity_changes`, and `outbox_messages`; no direct writes to core tables
- **Connector extensions**: Via `user_harness_extensions` → `workspace_harness_extensions` promotion

---

## Conformance Requirements

Any component, connector, or extension that ships against Overlord must:

1. **Provide a conformance manifest** (`conformance-manifest.yaml`) at its root declaring:
   - `contractVersion`: the version this component was validated against
   - `componentType`: one of `connector`, `extension`, `database-adapter`, `auth-provider`, `rest-module`
   - `componentKey`: stable lowercase identifier
   - All capabilities and extension points it uses

2. **Pass validation** via `ovld contract check <manifest-file>`
   (or the equivalent validation script until `ovld contract` is implemented)

3. **Respect ownership boundaries**: only interact with other components through declared surfaces

4. **Use namespaced identifiers** for all extension values — table names, JSON keys, event types, vocabulary extensions

5. **Declare all vocabulary extensions** from open vocabularies in its conformance manifest

See [`contract/conformance-manifest.schema.yaml`](contract/conformance-manifest.schema.yaml) for the required manifest shape.

## Extension Points

The only sanctioned ways to extend Overlord:

| Extension Point | Mechanism | Boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Custom agent connector | New adapter + `conformance-manifest.yaml` | Connector Layer |
| Custom harness | `user_harness_extensions` + workspace promotion | Extension System |
| Database adapter | Implement full logical schema + pass conformance tests | Database Layer |
| Database extension | `ext_<name>_` tables + `schema_migrations.component` | Database Layer |
| Auth/RBAC provider | Auth Layer service boundary | Auth Layer |
| REST extension | Namespaced endpoint prefix (`/ext/<name>/`) | REST API Layer |
| Open vocabulary values | Namespaced values declared in manifest | Database/Protocol Layer |

Attempting to extend Overlord through any other path — patching core tables directly, adding undeclared hook types, using closed vocabulary values — is a contract violation that must be resolved before the component ships.

See [`contract/extension-points.yaml`](contract/extension-points.yaml) for machine-readable declarations and the approved capability flag list.

## Controlled Vocabularies

### Closed (contract-version-bump required to add values)

- `objectives.state`: `future`, `draft`, `submitted`, `launching`, `executing`, `pending_delivery`, `complete`
- `project_statuses.type`: `draft`, `execute`, `review`, `complete`, `blocked`, `cancelled`
- `execution_requests.status`: `queued`, `claimed`, `launching`, `launched`, `failed`, `cleared`, `cancelled`, `expired`
- `agent_sessions.delivery_state`: `not_delivered`, `delivered`, `pending_redelivery`
- `ticket_events.type`: `update`, `user_follow_up`, `alert`, `discussion_summary`, `decision`, `ask`, `permission_request`, `delivery`, `execution_requested`, `awaiting_approval`, `status_change`
- `permission_requests.status`: `requested`, `approved`, `denied`, `expired`, `not_required`
- `idempotency_keys.status`: `in_progress`, `completed`, `failed`
- `audit_log.result`: `allowed`, `denied`, `failed`

### Open (extensions may add namespaced values)

- `workspaces.kind`, `users.kind`
- `execution_targets.type`, `project_resources.type`
- `artifacts.type`
- `ticket_events.source`, `entity_changes.entity_type`, `entity_changes.source`
- `outbox_messages.topic`, `worker_jobs.type`
- RBAC permission names
- Connector/agent identifiers

Full value lists live in the database schema contract "Controlled Vocabularies" section.

## Machine-Readable Contract Files

The `contract/` directory contains machine-readable counterparts:

- [`contract/components.yaml`](contract/components.yaml) — Component registry with capabilities and interface declarations
- [`contract/protocol-commands.yaml`](contract/protocol-commands.yaml) — Protocol command names, required flags, and response shape versions
- [`contract/extension-points.yaml`](contract/extension-points.yaml) — Sanctioned extension points and approved capability flags
- [`contract/conformance-manifest.schema.yaml`](contract/conformance-manifest.schema.yaml) — JSON Schema (YAML) for conformance manifests

| Change | Contract update required? |
| --- | --- |
| New component added | Yes — add to component registry and `contract/components.yaml` |
| New interaction surface | Yes — add to interaction surfaces and `contract/components.yaml` |
| Protocol command added/renamed | Yes — update `contract/protocol-commands.yaml` |
| Protocol command flag changed | Yes — update `contract/protocol-commands.yaml`; bump version if breaking |
| Database table/column added | Yes — update `09-database-schema-contract.md` |
| Closed vocabulary value added | Yes — requires contract version bump |
| Open vocabulary value promoted to core | Yes — add to `09-database-schema-contract.md` Controlled Vocabularies |
| New extension point | Yes — add to `contract/extension-points.yaml` and this document |
| New connector capability flag | Yes — add to `approvedConnectorCapabilities` in `contract/extension-points.yaml` |
| New connector shipped | Conformance manifest only; no contract update unless new capabilities needed |
| Extension shipped | Conformance manifest only; no contract update unless new extension points needed |

### Procedure for contract-modifying changes

1. Read and understand the current contract (this document + relevant `contract/*.yaml` files)
2. Draft the required contract changes
3. **Increment the contract version** in this document header and in `contract/components.yaml`
4. Add a changelog entry to this document
5. Implement the changes in code and other docs
6. Verify any affected component's conformance manifest passes `ovld contract check`

**The implementation code must not land before the contract update.** If you are implementing code that would conflict with or extend the existing contract without updating it first, stop and update the contract first.
